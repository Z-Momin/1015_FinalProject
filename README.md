## Analyzing Premeditation in Political Speech Patterns
In this project we analyzed the deliberate choices that politicians make in their written speeches and how that may differ from their true linguistic spoken patterns. Linguistics provide insight on personality traits and larger differences in Flesch-Kinkaid scores between written and spoken words may indicate higher degrees of duplicity employed by politicians simply to capture voters. Our paper is available [here](https://github.com/Z-Momin/1015_FinalProject/blob/main/PoliticianAnalysis.pdf).
